##General

### Why another Project Management tool?
There are many tools in the market that facilitates automation of various aspects of project management. 

Project Management in itself is a vast area comprising of - 
1. Initiation
2. Planning
3. Execution
4. Tracking
5. Closure

In addition you need to consider the SDLC model like Waterfall, Agile, etc. Then there is aspects like tracking Project Financials, Project Quality, Project Risks and whole lot of other things. Reporting is one more aspect that really drains current project managers.

No tool, currently available, can cover the entire gamut of Project Management. It would be foolish to even attempt to build such a tool that automates the entire project management ecosystem. Of course, great explorers and inventors where foolish and acomplished great things. Our attempt is not to attempt great things. 
There are amazing tools available that covers various aspects of Project Management. We are trying to plug those areas where there is definite lacuna. 

That's how we defined the objectives of Crux.

### Why did you use PHP?
It looked the easiest of all. I am sure there could have been a better choice. Alas it has been made.

###Why did you not use those awesome PHP frameworks?
We wanted zero learning curve. We are open to suggestions and contributions to introduce PHP framework in Crux. Make sure that we can implement it incrementally and progressively. A rewrite of entire Crux should not be the agenda.
